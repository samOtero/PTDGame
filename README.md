# PTDGame
A 3D reimagining of the original Pokemon Tower Defense game made in Unity.

# Moved to Godot Engine
This repo will no longer be updated as I have moved to the Open Source Godot Game Engine and rebuilding the game using that.
Here is the link to the new repo: https://github.com/samOtero/PTD_Game_Godot
